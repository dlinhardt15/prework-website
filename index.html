                Where it all began...
            </p>
            <p>
                Born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, I was always looking ahead. When I was in middle school, I couldn't wait to get to high school.
                In high school, I was itching for my driver's license and the opportunity to go to college on the east coast.
            </p>
            <p>
                I fulfilled my dream by going to NYU and living for four years in New York, with one semester spent studying abroad in Tel Aviv.
                Once graduation came along, I was feeling a bit chilly so I moved back to LA and spent four years living the city life out west.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, New York is irresistable, and in March of 2021, I moved back.
                After four years of working at hotel front desks, I had worked my way up to the top of the Front Office and realized, "This is not what I want to do with my life."
            </p>
            <p>
                After months of job searching, self-reflection, and multiple career assessments, I decided to try out some coding. I subscribed to Codecademy and started learning Python.
                I was really enjoying it and decided to do some more research into coding bootcamps and, after a few informational calls, decided on the Flatiron School.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm really excited to take the next few months and learn front-end and back-end development skills. If I had to guess, just from doing some prework, 
                I can see myself having a future in front-end web development. I love being able to really visualize how my work can change things.
